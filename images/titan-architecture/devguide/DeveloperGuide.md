> *This developer guide is an extra document, aimed at getting new developers up to speed quickly. It is loosely based on parts from Rozanski & Woods (2012) and the entire architectural documentation, but moreover it is written in a practical way and thus hopefully very helpful for the Titan documentation. The [Maven Developer Centre]( http://maven.apache.org/developers/index.html) is used as input for this documentation. The development guide also served as the basis for some [recommendations](../ArchitecturalRecommendations.md#on-the-basis-of-the-developer-guide).*

# Developer Guide ![Titan logo](../diagrams/titan-kneeling-small.png)

Titan is an open source project. Currently it is maintained mainly by the people that were initially involved in Titan. In effort to open up Titan to external contributors this developer guide is created. Participation in the community is greatly appreciated. Your involvement can speed up development, increase your own expertise and you give something back to the community that has given you the software for free. There are numerous ways you can contribute.

* Join the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/aureliusgraphs) on Google Groups and answer other users' questions
* Report bugs, feature requests and other issues on [Github](https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan/issues)
* [Build Titan](BuildingTitan.md) yourself in order to fix bugs
* Help [test releases](DevelopingTitan.md#testing)
* Help with the [documentation]( https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan/wiki) by pointing out areas that are lacking or unclear, and if you are so inclined, submitting patches to correct it. You can [volunteer](mailto:info@thinkaurelius.com) to help collate and organize information that is already there.
